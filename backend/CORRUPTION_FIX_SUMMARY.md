# Model Corruption Fix Summary

## Issue
The error "invalid load key, '\x0d'" was occurring when trying to load `model.pkl`, indicating file corruption. The '\x0d' character (carriage return) suggested the pickle file was corrupted during saving or transfer.

## Root Cause
- The `model.pkl` file (9MB) was corrupted and could not be unpickled
- The file existed but contained corrupted data
- This was causing the entire model loading system to fail

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling in `services.py`
- Added try-catch blocks around model loading to handle `pickle.UnpicklingError`, `EOFError`, and `ValueError`
- Improved error messages to identify corrupted files
- Models that fail to load are now properly excluded

### 2. Smart Model Filtering
- Updated `get_available_models()` to test-load each model file before including it in the available models list
- Corrupted models are automatically filtered out and logged as warnings
- Only verified, working models are presented to users

### 3. Created Diagnostic Tools
- `fix_corrupted_model.py`: Script to identify and optionally remove corrupted model files
- `quick_test.py`: Fast verification script for testing model functionality
- Enhanced logging throughout the prediction pipeline

## Results
✅ **Before Fix**: 0/5 models working (all blocked by corrupted model.pkl)
✅ **After Fix**: 4/4 valid models working perfectly

### Working Models:
- `decision_tree_model.pkl` ✅
- `random_forest_model.pkl` ✅ 
- `logistic_regression_model.pkl` ✅
- `xgboost_model.pkl` ✅

### Removed/Filtered:
- `model.pkl` ❌ (corrupted, automatically filtered out)

## Frontend Impact
- Dropdown now shows only working models (4 instead of 5)
- Users can successfully select and use any available model
- No more error messages about corrupted models in the UI

## Prevention
- The system now gracefully handles corrupted model files
- Future corrupted files will be automatically detected and excluded
- Clear logging helps identify issues quickly

## Files Modified
- `services.py`: Enhanced error handling and model filtering
- `CSVAnalysisPage.jsx`: Already had dynamic model loading (no changes needed)
- Added diagnostic scripts for future maintenance

## Manual Cleanup (Optional)
To remove the corrupted file completely:
```bash
rm models/model.pkl
```

Or regenerate all models:
```bash
python train_ml_models.py
```
